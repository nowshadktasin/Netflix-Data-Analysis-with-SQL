# Business Problems and Solutions
## 1. Count of Movies vs TV Shows  
This query helped count the number of movies versus TV shows available in the Netflix database, offering insight into the distribution of content types.

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(type) AS count
FROM 
    netflix
GROUP BY 
    type;
```


### Explanation:
This query counts the number of **Movies** and **TV Shows** in the `netflix` table.

1. **`SELECT type`**: Retrieves the `type` column, which indicates whether the content is a Movie or TV Show.
2. **`COUNT(type) AS count`**: Counts the occurrences of each `type` (Movie or TV Show) and labels it as `count`.
3. **`FROM netflix`**: Specifies the source table for the data.
4. **`GROUP BY type`**: Groups the data by `type`, so the `COUNT()` function is applied to each distinct value (Movies and TV Shows).

This query helps analyze the distribution of content types in the dataset.


### Table: Count of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix

| **Type**   | **Count** |
|------------|------------|
| Movie      | 6,131      |
| TV Show    | 2,676      |

*Table showing the number of movies and TV shows in the Netflix database.*

### Key Insights:

1. **Movies Dominance**:
   - **Movies** are the dominant type of content on Netflix, making up 6,131 entries, which is more than double the number of TV shows. This could indicate that Netflix offers a vast collection of movies to cater to its global audience.

2. **Significant TV Show Library**:
   - With **2,676** TV shows available, Netflix also maintains a strong focus on serialized content. This may highlight the platform‚Äôs strategy to encourage long-term engagement through episodic releases.

3. **Varied Content Strategy**:
   - The split between movies and TV shows suggests Netflix‚Äôs balanced approach to providing both short-form (movies) and long-form (TV shows) content, catering to a wide range of viewer preferences. While movies are more abundant, TV shows drive sustained viewership through series formats.

These insights help understand Netflix's content strategy, focusing on both volume (movies) and engagement (TV shows) to attract and retain a diverse audience base.

## 2. Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows  
This query helps identify the most frequently occurring content ratings for both movies and TV shows in Netflix‚Äôs library. The ratings provide insight into the type of content that dominates Netflix‚Äôs offerings.

```sql
SELECT  
    type,
    rating,
    count
FROM
    (SELECT
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) as count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1,2
    ) as Table1
WHERE ranking = 1;
```


### Explanation:
This query finds the **most common rating** for each content type (Movies and TV Shows).

1. **`SELECT type, rating, count`**: Retrieves the `type` (Movie or TV Show), `rating`, and the corresponding count of occurrences.
2. **`RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)`**: This ranks the ratings within each content type (`Movie` or `TV Show`), ordering them by their count in descending order.
3. **`GROUP BY type, rating`**: Groups the data by both `type` and `rating`, so the count of each rating for each content type can be calculated.
4. **`WHERE ranking = 1`**: Filters the results to show only the top-ranked (most common) rating for each content type.

This query helps identify the most frequent rating for both Movies and TV Shows.

### Table: Most Common Ratings for Movies and TV Shows on Netflix

| **Type**   | **Rating** | **Count** |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Movie      | TV-MA      | 2,062     |
| TV Show    | TV-MA      | 1,145     |

*Table showing the most frequent rating for movies and TV shows on Netflix.*

### Key Insights:

1. **TV-MA Dominance**:
   - The rating **TV-MA** (Mature Audience) is the most common for both movies and TV shows. This rating appears **2,062** times for movies and **1,145** times for TV shows, reflecting that a significant portion of Netflix‚Äôs content is targeted toward mature audiences.
  
2. **Content for Adults**:
   - The prevalence of the TV-MA rating highlights Netflix's focus on adult-oriented content, particularly in genres like drama, crime, and thriller, which often cater to mature viewers.

3. **Audience Preferences**:
   - Given that both movies and TV shows share the same most common rating, it suggests that Netflix tailors much of its library to a similar audience demographic, possibly to meet the preferences of binge-watchers and adult viewers who consume serialized content as well as standalone films.

This analysis demonstrates that mature-rated content plays a central role in Netflix's catalog, offering a variety of shows and films aimed at adult audiences.

    COUNT(*) AS count_of_movies
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Explanation:

- **Extract Actor Names**:

- **Filter for Indian Movies**:  
  The `WHERE country = 'India'` clause ensures that the query only considers content produced in India.

- **Count the Number of Movies**:  
  The query groups the results by each actor's name and counts how many times each actor appears in the movies using the `COUNT(*)` function.

- **Sort by Movie Count**:  
  Results are sorted in descending order by the number of movies each actor has appeared in, using `ORDER BY 2 DESC`.

- **Limit to Top 10**:  
  The `LIMIT 10` clause restricts the output to the top 10 actors with the highest number of movie appearances.

#### Result:
The top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India are:

1. **Anupam Kher** - 40 movies

- The **main query** groups the results by **category** and **type** (Movie or TV Show) and counts the number of content items in each category using `COUNT(*)`, storing the count in **content_count**.

### Categorized Content Based on 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords

| **Category** | **Type**   | **Content Count** |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|
