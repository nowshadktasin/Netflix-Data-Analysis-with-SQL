# Tools I used  
For my in-depth analysis of the Netflix Movie Database, I relied on the following key tools:  
- **SQL:** For writing queries and extracting insights from the database  
- **PostgreSQL:** My database management system of choice for efficient data handling  
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used for writing and running SQL scripts  
- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control and collaboration, ensuring my SQL analysis is accessible and trackable

## 1. Count of Movies vs TV Shows  
This query helped count the number of movies versus TV shows available in the Netflix database, offering insight into the distribution of content types.

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(type) AS count
FROM 
    netflix
GROUP BY 
    type;
```

The query groups the content by its type (either "Movie" or "TV Show") and counts the number of occurrences for each.

### Table: Count of Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix

| **Type**   | **Count** |
|------------|------------|
| Movie      | 6,131      |

*Table showing the number of movies and TV shows in the Netflix database.*

### Key Insights:

1. **Movies Dominance**:
   - **Movies** are the dominant type of content on Netflix, making up 6,131 entries, which is more than double the number of TV shows. This could indicate that Netflix offers a vast collection of movies to cater to its global audience.

2. **Significant TV Show Library**:
   - With **2,676** TV shows available, Netflix also maintains a strong focus on serialized content. This may highlight the platform‚Äôs strategy to encourage long-term engagement through episodic releases.

3. **Varied Content Strategy**:
   - The split between movies and TV shows suggests Netflix‚Äôs balanced approach to providing both short-form (movies) and long-form (TV shows) content, catering to a wide range of viewer preferences. While movies are more abundant, TV shows drive sustained viewership through series formats.

These insights help understand Netflix's content strategy, focusing on both volume (movies) and engagement (TV shows) to attract and retain a diverse audience base.

## 2. Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows  
This query helps identify the most frequently occurring content ratings for both movies and TV shows in Netflix‚Äôs library. The ratings provide insight into the type of content that dominates Netflix‚Äôs offerings.

```sql
SELECT  
    type,
    rating,
    count
FROM
    (SELECT
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) as count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1,2
    ) as Table1
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

The query ranks each rating within its content type (Movies or TV Shows) based on how frequently they appear and filters out the most common rating for each type.

### Table: Most Common Ratings for Movies and TV Shows on Netflix

| **Type**   | **Rating** | **Count** |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Movie      | TV-MA      | 2,062     |
| TV Show    | TV-MA      | 1,145     |

*Table showing the most frequent rating for movies and TV shows on Netflix.*

### Key Insights:

1. **TV-MA Dominance**:
   - The rating **TV-MA** (Mature Audience) is the most common for both movies and TV shows. This rating appears **2,062** times for movies and **1,145** times for TV shows, reflecting that a significant portion of Netflix‚Äôs content is targeted toward mature audiences.
  
2. **Content for Adults**:
   - The prevalence of the TV-MA rating highlights Netflix's focus on adult-oriented content, particularly in genres like drama, crime, and thriller, which often cater to mature viewers.

3. **Audience Preferences**:
   - Given that both movies and TV shows share the same most common rating, it suggests that Netflix tailors much of its library to a similar audience demographic, possibly to meet the preferences of binge-watchers and adult viewers who consume serialized content as well as standalone films.

This analysis demonstrates that mature-rated content plays a central role in Netflix's catalog, offering a variety of shows and films aimed at adult audiences.

    netflix
WHERE 
    type = 'Movie' 
    AND release_year = 2020;
```

This query filters the Netflix content to show only movies released in the specific year 2020.

### 4. Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

This query helps to identify the countries that contribute the most content to Netflix. By analyzing the country field, we split and clean the data to get a more accurate count for each individual country.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM(
    SELECT
    TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country,','))) AS country,
    COUNT(*) AS count_of_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
)
as Table1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY count_of_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Explanation:

1. **TRIM and UNNEST Functions**:
   - The `TRIM()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the country names to ensure uniformity.
   - The `UNNEST()` function splits entries where multiple countries are listed, ensuring each country is treated individually.
